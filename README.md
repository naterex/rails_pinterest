This is a project to make a Pinterest clonse using Ruby on Rails.

Users can create pins (with title, description, and image) and also vote on their favorite pins.

I made this project because I wanted to learn about:
  - making a responsive layout that scales with the viewport size
  - using HAML (HTML Abstraction Markup Language) instead of ERB
  - adding forms using the gem Simple_form
  - how to make nested forms using the gem Cocoon
  - enabling image uploading for users using the gem Paperclip
  - using the gem Devise for user sign up and login

## Stack
  - Ruby version: 2.2.1
  - Rails version: 4.2.4
  - Database: SQLite
  - Frontend: Bootstrap
  - HAML markup language instead of ERB
